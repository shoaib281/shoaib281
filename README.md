## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a developer and student in the UK. Curerently, I'm a first year student at [Kings College London](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/) studying Computer Science.

I have experience in a range of languages including Python, Lua and Javascript and technologies such as PostgreSQL, Bootstrap and Git. At the moment, I'm learning Java.

I made a web-app that allows you to sign up to email updates of your favourite stocks: http://www.stockpricedelta.xyz/

I also have a procedural world generation showcase on roblox. [Try it out!](https://www.roblox.com/games/6156846028/Procedural-Generation)

**Open to internships and jobs**
