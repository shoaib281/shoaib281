## Hi There ðŸ‘‹

**Open to internships and jobs**

I'm a developer and student in the UK. Currently, I'm a first year student at [Kings College London](https://www.kcl.ac.uk/) studying Computer Science.

I have experience in a range of languages including Python, Lua and Javascript and technologies such as PostgreSQL, Bootstrap and Git. At the moment, I'm working with C++.

Here are some projects that I've worked on: 

- A suite of finance related applications. It's [growing](https://github.com/shoaib281/finance-suite).

- A procedural world generator on roblox that involves houses, trees and road networks. [Try it out!](https://www.roblox.com/games/6156846028/Procedural-Generation) 

- A fun [multiplayer tower defense game](https://github.com/shoaib281/tower-defense-battles) that can be played by people on the same network.
